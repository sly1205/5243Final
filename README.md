# 5243Final

All core implementation is included in the file maincode.ipynb, with explanatory comments throughout. However, due to local hardware limitations, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) could not be executed on my laptop. Therefore, the segmentation-related code is placed in a separate script, sam_masksuccess.py, which is designed to run successfully on Google Colab.

Please note that the original dataset used in this project cannot be publicly shared, so it has not been uploaded.
